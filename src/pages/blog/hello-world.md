Hello world! This is a site that we setup very quickly just to have a place to put our [Green
Ember](https://sdsmith.com/the-green-ember-series/) fan art.

For a while we've had original music and recordings for all of the songs in the green ember books,
and we haven't really shared them anywhere, so we'll be putting those up on here soon.

We also are playing around with an [NES] game inspired by the [Green Ember: Helmer in the Dragon
Tomb kickstarter][ks]!

Not sure if it'll turn into anything yet, but we need a place to put it, so here we go!
