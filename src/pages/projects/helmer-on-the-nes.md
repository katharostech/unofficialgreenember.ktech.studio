## Play Now!

Yes! You can play what terribly little we have of the game so far in your browser right now! [Check
it out!][emu].

You probably want to plug in a game remote, and after the screen loads be sure to click on the
screen to focus it so that the browser can play the sound from the page.

## What Is It?

We are experimenting with making an _actual_ NES ( [Nintendo Entertainment System][nes] ) game for Helmer
in the Dragon Tomb, inspired by the [kickstarter], which hasn't finished yet, and is completely,
100% not affiliated with us.

Anyway, Sam was giving away a fake NES cartridge just for the nostalgia as a part of one of the
events and he also said that some of his favorite games were old NES games.

We were thinking that'd it'd awesome if we could make _real life_ **working** NES cartridges for
Helmer.

## Will This Actually Work?

It can! We can actually make a real, working game that you can put into an authentic NES console.

We're not talking a retro-themed game that _looks_ like an NES game, we're talking real,
honest-to-goodness 8-bit everything.

That said, this is really just an experiment right now and there's a large possibility we just won't
find the time to finish it.
