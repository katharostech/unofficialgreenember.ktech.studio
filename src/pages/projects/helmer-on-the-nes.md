## What Is It?

We are experimenting with making an _actual_ NES ( [Nintendo Entertainment System][nes] ) game for
Helmer in the Dragon Tomb, inspired by the [kickstarter], which hasn't finished yet.

Sam was giving away a fake NES cartridge just for the nostalgia as a part of one of the events and
he also said that some of his favorite games were old NES games.

We were thinking that'd it'd awesome if we could make _real life_ **working** NES cartridges for
Helmer, but this is all 100% unofficial!

## Will This Actually Work?

It can! We can actually make a real, working game that you can put into an authentic NES console.

We're not talking a retro-themed game that _looks_ like an NES game, we're talking real,
honest-to-goodness 8-bit everything.

That said, this is really just an experiment right now and there's a large possibility we just won't
find the time to finish it.

## Play Now!

You can play what terribly little we have of the game so far in your browser right now! So far we
only have a title screen that makes a noise when you press the start button, and a screen where you
can slide the character around, but progress has been fairly steady. This page and demo will be
updated as we make more progress.

[Play Online!][emu]

You probably want to plug in a game remote, and after the screen loads be sure to click on the
screen to focus it so that the browser can play the sound from the page.
